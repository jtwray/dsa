 given a pot of soil and a watering pail; 
 determine if the water will pool partway through or 
 if there is a clear path for the excess water to flow through the soil to the bottom of pot and drain
 assume the provided graph represents the soil compactness such that 
a '0' denotes a clear path and 
a '1' denotes a blocked path
 eg:      _______________
          \--1-0-0-1-1--/
           |-0-1-0-1-1-|
           |-1-1-0-0-1-|
           \-1-1-1-0-1-/
            ```````````

  [0,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,0,0,1],
  [1,1,1,0,1]]
